# multiple_linear_Reg


This notebook presents a complete end-to-end implementation of Multiple Linear Regression using Python, where the model is built from scratch using a custom regression class instead of relying solely on pre-built libraries. The project covers the full machine learning workflow, including importing essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, loading and inspecting the dataset to understand multiple independent features and the target variable, and performing basic exploratory data analysis to study relationships between inputs and output. The data is prepared by selecting relevant features, separating independent and dependent variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. 

A custom Multiple Linear Regression class is implemented to handle coefficient calculation, model fitting, and prediction logic, providing a clear understanding of the underlying mathematics of regression. Predictions are generated on unseen test data, and model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score. The project also includes visualization and interpretation of results to understand how multiple features jointly influence the predicted outcome. Through this work, I gained practical insight into how multiple linear regression works internally, how to move from raw data to model evaluation, and how core machine learning concepts can be applied to real-world datasets without treating ML models as black boxes.
